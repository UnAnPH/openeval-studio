# The reference solution. Replace the example below with the steps that solve
# your task end-to-end. Full guidance: docs/task-anatomy.md → solve.sh section.
#
# Rules:
#   - Must genuinely solve the task. No hardcoded outputs that pass tests
#     without computing the answer (the `solution_quality` criterion checks).
#   - Must produce reward 1.0 when run as Harbor's oracle (validate.sh enforces).
#   - If the solution exceeds ~20 lines, factor logic into solution/solve.py
#     (or .js, .rs, etc.) and call from this script.

# REPLACE: the example below solves the hello-world example task.
